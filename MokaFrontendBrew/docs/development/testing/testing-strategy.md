# Testing Strategy 🚀

This project follows a robust testing strategy to ensure code quality, reliability, and make development smoother!

## Our Testing Toolkit 🧰

- **Unit Testing:**
  - **Vitest:** Our choice for blazing-fast unit tests, tight Vite integration, awesome TypeScript support, and to stay on the cutting edge. ⚡️
- **Component Testing:**
  - **React Testing Library:** We test React components like our users experience them, boosting component robustness. 🙂
- **Integration & E2E Testing (Web & Desktop):**
  - **Playwright:** Handles web and Electron desktop testing across browsers like a champ 💪
- **Mobile E2E Testing**
  - **Appium (with React Native bindings):** The go-to for reliable testing of React Native apps on both iOS and Android. 📱
- **[Optional] Visual Regression Testing**
  - **Percy, Chromatic:** Our eyes can miss things! These tools catch unintended visual bugs for pixel-perfect UIs across different devices. 🔎

## The Testing Flow

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - These isolate and verify the smallest pieces of our code – functions and internal logic. 🔬
2. **Component Tests:**
   - Focus on how React components render with different inputs and how they react to clicks, changes, etc. 🧩
   - React Testing Library helps us test from the user's point of view.
   - Storybook shines here for both development and visual testing. ✨
3. **Integration Tests:**
   - Examine how multiple components work together, covering data flow and state management. 🤝
4. **E2E Tests:**
   - Simulate full user journeys across web, desktop, and mobile versions of the application, ensuring core functionality rocks. end-to-end symbol

## Jumpstart Your Testing

**Writing Tests:**

- Check out docs for Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and Appium. They'll be your guides! 📚
- Keep test files organized alongside the code they test.

**CI/CD All The Way:**

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run our tests whenever code changes or before we release - this saves so much time! 🙌

## Notes 💡

- Focus tests on the most critical parts of the app.
- Balance good coverage with test speed.
- Our testing strategy will evolve as our project grows! 🌱
