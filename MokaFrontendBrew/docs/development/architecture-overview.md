# Project Structure and Architecture 💻

\*\*Overview 😎

Our project adopts a monorepo structure for streamlined code management and leverages clean architecture principles to promote maintainability and separation of concerns. Here's a breakdown:

## Backend (.NET 8) 🚀

- **Clean Architecture:** The backend follows clean architecture guidelines, separating domain, application logic, and infrastructure.
- **Data Access:** Data persistence layer (e.g., Entity Framework Core) 🗄️
- **API Layer:** RESTful API (ASP.NET Core Web API) exposes endpoints for the frontend. ✨

## Frontend 🎨

- **React and TypeScript:** Frontend built using React and TypeScript for a type-safe and component-based approach. ⚛️
- **UI Shared Libraries:** Reusable UI components are organized in packages. 📦
- **Atomic Design:** UI components follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms). 🔬
- **State Management:** A state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) potentially used for complex state. 🧠
- **Data Fetching:** Library like React Query or Apollo Client for interaction with the backend API. 🌐

## Packages (Monorepo)

- **core:** Domain models, services, shared data transfer objects (DTOs). 📦
- **framework:** App bootstrapping, configuration, dependency injection. ⚙️
- **ui-utils:** Generic UI helpers (layout, theming, etc.) 🎨
- **web-desktop-ui-components:** UI components for web/desktop. 💻
- **mobile-ui-components:** UI components for mobile devices. 📱
- **utils:** General-purpose helper functions. 🛠️

## Documentation (`docs` folder) 📖

- **Getting Started** 🚀
- **Packages Overview** (`core`, `framework`, `ui`)
- **Backend Architecture**
- **Development Practices** (coding conventions, testing)

## Additional Notes 💡

- This architecture is adaptable and scalable. 💪
- Communication between frontend and backend occurs primarily through the backend's RESTful API.
