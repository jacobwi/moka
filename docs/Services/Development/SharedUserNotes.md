# User Handling in AuthenticationService and Bookmarking Application

## AuthenticationService

### Base User Entity

```csharp
public class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public List<string> Roles { get; set; }
    // Other common user properties
}
```

### Base User DTO

```csharp
public class BaseUserDto
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public List<string> Roles { get; set; }
    // Other common DTO fields
}
```

## Bookmarking Application

### Bookmarking Specific User Entity

The Bookmarking application extends the basic User entity to include bookmarking-specific properties.

```csharp
public class BookmarkingUser : User  // Inheritance from the base User entity
{
    public List<Bookmark> Bookmarks { get; set; }
    // Additional bookmarking-specific properties
}
```

### Bookmark Entity

This entity represents a bookmark in the Bookmarking application.

```csharp
public class Bookmark
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string URL { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    // Other bookmark properties
}
```

### Extended User DTO for Bookmarking Application

The Bookmarking application defines an `ExtendedUserDto` that includes additional properties related to bookmarking.

```csharp
public class ExtendedUserDto : BaseUserDto  // Inheritance from BaseUserDto
{
    public List<BookmarkDto> Bookmarks { get; set; }
    // Additional DTO fields specific to bookmarking
}
```

### Bookmark DTO

This DTO represents the data transfer object for a bookmark.

```csharp
public class BookmarkDto
{
    public string URL { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    // Other fields necessary for transferring bookmark data
}
```

## Data Transformation

The Bookmarking application includes logic to transform `BaseUserDto` into `ExtendedUserDto`, enriching it with bookmarking-specific information. This transformation is typically performed in a service layer or through the use of a library like AutoMapper.

## API Design

The AuthenticationService API provides endpoints to retrieve `BaseUserDto`. The Bookmarking application has its own set of APIs that use the `ExtendedUserDto`, offering endpoints to manage bookmarks and user profiles with bookmarking information.

## Documentation

Both the AuthenticationService and the Bookmarking application provide clear API documentation, outlining the structure of the base and extended user DTOs, and detailing how clients can interact with each service.
