# Welcome to MokaSuite üöÄ

MokaSuite is a comprehensive ecosystem comprising `MokaServices` for the backend and `MokaFrontBrew` for the frontend. Designed with flexibility in mind, it supports a range of applications from bookmarking to password management, with the infrastructure to expand further. Our goal is to cater to both self-hosters and cloud-based applications, ensuring adaptability and scalability.

## MokaServices ‚òï - Backend Microservices

MokaServices is the backbone of our suite, built on a microservices architecture that emphasizes scalability, resilience, and modular growth. Each microservice is designed to perform its function optimally while seamlessly integrating with the broader ecosystem.

### Tech Stack & Architecture:

- **.NET 8**: Our microservices are crafted with the latest .NET framework, ensuring performance and robustness.
- **ASP.NET Core**: For building high-performance web APIs.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Serving as our ORM for database interactions, providing a seamless data access layer.
- **SQL Server & MongoDB**: A blend of SQL and NoSQL databases, catering to the diverse data storage needs of our services.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration support for deploying our services in varied environments.
- **RabbitMQ + Azure Service Bus**: For reliable message brokering between services, ensuring decoupled communication and scalability.
- **Ocelot API Gateway**: Unifies our service endpoints, providing a single entry point to the frontend, simplifying API consumption.


### Microservices Overview:

- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication, leveraging JWT for secure token generation.
- **Bookmarking Service**: Handles bookmark storage and organization, optimized for quick retrieval and management.
- **Password Manager Service**: Secures user passwords, implementing encryption standards for data safety.

...with the flexibility to introduce additional services as the suite evolves.

### üìö Documentation:

While our initial docs are in raw files, we're transitioning to VitePress to offer a more interactive and comprehensive documentation experience.

## MokaFrontBrew üåø - Frontend Applications

MokaFrontBrew brings our services to the users with a series of React-based applications housed in a monorepo. Designed for scalability, each app interfaces seamlessly with its corresponding microservice, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

### Development Ecosystem:

- **React & TypeScript**: Our choice for building user interfaces with type safety and modern JS features.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Facilitates shared dependencies and streamlined cross-app development.

### Testing Frameworks üß™

- **Vitest**: For efficient unit and integration testing within our React monorepo.
- **XUnit**: The testing framework for our .NET microservices, ensuring back-end reliability.
- **Playwright**: Conducts end-to-end tests across our applications, validating the user experience.

We adopt **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring our features meet user expectations.
